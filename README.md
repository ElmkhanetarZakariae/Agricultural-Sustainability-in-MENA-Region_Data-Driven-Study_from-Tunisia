# Project Overview:

In addition to my participation in the AURORA Summer School in 2023, I contributed to a comprehensive Households Socio-economic and Biophysical Survey aimed at understanding the sustainability of farming systems in the MENA region. This survey was part of the AURORA Autumn School, which focused on sustainable agriculture and social-ecological systems in Tunisia. The project aimed to address key challenges faced by farmers, such as water stress, resource management, and the socio-economic viability of agricultural practices.

The AURORA Summer School brought together graduate students and early-career researchers from Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, and Germany to tackle complex issues in agro-food systems and sustainability. The event involved lectures, case studies, and problem-based learning activities that focused on the agricultural, environmental, and institutional challenges of the MENA region. It provided a platform for interdisciplinary exchange among researchers and helped build expertise in analyzing social-ecological systems, with a focus on food security, water use, and resource management.

# Role and Responsibilities in Data Collection:

As part of the Households Socio-economic and Biophysical Survey, I was involved in data collection, survey design, and analysis to understand the farming systems' sustainability in Tunisia. The survey aimed to characterize:

1. The resource base of farm households,
2. Their livelihood strategies,
3. Current farming practices, and
4. The environmental impact of those practices.
   
This provided valuable insights into the challenges farmers face, such as water management, soil health, and the economic viability of their agricultural activities.

- Survey Design and Implementation: I played a significant role in designing the survey and developing questions that would help assess the socio-economic and biophysical conditions of the farmers. The survey covered topics like land use, irrigation practices, biodiversity, and economic resources.
- Field Data Collection: I participated in direct interviews with farmers, collecting data on aspects such as:
/Socio-demographic factors (age, education, family structure),
/Economic assets (land area, agricultural tools, animal breeding practices),
/Environmental assets (irrigation and water use, salinity, soil health),
/Farming practices (cropping methods, soil management, use of pesticides), 
/Governance (relationships with local stakeholders, involvement in water management decisions).
- Data Analysis: After collecting the survey data, I contributed to the data analysis process, which involved organizing and interpreting large datasets to identify key trends. I used tools and methodologies to analyze relationships between socio-economic factors and farming sustainability. For example, I analyzed how water stress impacts the productivity of farmers and examined the effectiveness of different governance structures in managing agricultural resources.
  
# Key Survey Areas:

1. Socio-demographic Information: Information on the age, education, and livelihood strategies of farm household members.
2. Economic Assets: Data on the resource base, such as land size, tools, and animal breeding practices.
3. Environmental Assets: Assessing the impact of farming practices on soil health, water use, salinity, and biodiversity.
4. Governance: Exploring how farmers interact with local stakeholders and their involvement in water management issues.

# Outcomes and Value as an Agricultural Engineer and Data Analyst:

This project provided me with the opportunity to apply and refine my skills as both an agricultural engineer and a data analyst, specifically in the context of sustainable agriculture and environmental policy. Key takeaways and contributions I gained from this experience include:

1. Field Data Collection and Survey Design: I gained practical experience in designing and administering surveys, engaging directly with local farmers to gather both quantitative and qualitative data. This hands-on involvement enhanced my ability to create effective survey instruments that address complex socio-environmental issues, while also ensuring the collection of relevant, reliable data in the field.
2. Data Processing and Statistical Analysis: Leveraging my analytical background, I utilized advanced statistical tools to process and interpret large datasets, identifying correlations between farming practices and sustainability outcomes. For example, analyzing water usage patterns and their links to soil erosion and crop yield deepened my understanding of how resource management impacts agricultural productivity and environmental health.
3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Working on this project alongside researchers from environmental sciences, economics, and social sciences allowed me to broaden my perspective and apply a multidisciplinary approach to data analysis. This strengthened my ability to consider various factors when assessing farming systems and sustainability challenges.
4. Actionable Insights for Policy Development: By analyzing the survey results, I contributed to developing evidence-based recommendations aimed at improving resource management and guiding policy interventions in the MENA region. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between data analysis and practical policy recommendations, ensuring that the findings could be used to address real-world agricultural sustainability issues.
   
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct field-based research, manage and analyze complex datasets, and provide actionable insights that support sustainable agricultural practices and environmental governance. It highlights my capacity to collaborate effectively with interdisciplinary teams and contribute to large-scale projects aimed at addressing global sustainability challenges.

The experience has strengthened my technical proficiency as both a data analyst and agricultural engineer, showcasing my ability to work on projects with real-world impact. It underscores my commitment to advancing sustainability research and policy development, ultimately driving positive change in the field of agriculture.
